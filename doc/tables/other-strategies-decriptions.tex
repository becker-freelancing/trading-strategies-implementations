    \textbf{Parabolic SAR strategy}                      & If the SAR value crosses below the current price a long position is opened. Otherwise, if the SAR value crosses above the current price a short position is opened. The stop loss is set at the SAR value at position opening and the limit level is set is set at double the distance from the current price to the current SAR value. Before a new position is opened by the described algorithm, all positions in the other direction are closed. \\

    \textbf{RSI strategy}                                & If the RSI crosses above 70 a short position is opened. Otherwise, if the RSI drops below 30 a long position is opened.
