    abstract = "Economic and financial time series have frequently been successfully modelled by autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) schemes of the type, where $\epsilon$ tis an orthogonal sequence (that is,E($\epsilon$ t) = 0, E($\epsilon$ t$\epsilon$1 s ) = 0 for all t ≠ s), L is the backshift operator for which Lyt= yt − 1 and a(L) b(L) are finite-order lag polynomials, whose leading coefficients are a0 = b0 = 1. Parsimonious schemes (often with p + q ≤ 3) are usually selected in practice either by informal `model identification' processes such as those described in the text by Box and Jenkins (1976) or more formal order-selection criteria which penalize choices of large p and/or q. Model (1) is assumed to be irreducible, so that a(L) and b(L) have no common factors. The model (1) and the time series ytare said to have an autoregressive unit root if a(L) factors as (1 − L)a1(L) and a moving-average unit root if b(L) factors as (1 − L)a1(L)",
